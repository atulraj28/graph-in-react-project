# work of this code <br>
it has a static data which is used to make intractive responsive graph <br>
![scatter graph](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111493898/188261242-3eb99da6-a636-4f2a-9e92-7f7fde134273.png)<br>
this graph is between Hue and color intensity from the data in increaseing order of color intensity.

# Building the project
first set up vs code for react.js and add yarn<br>.
then add chart from react.js<br>
start making changes in app.js.<br>
delete default code and add the data.<br>
set the data as array.<br>
import  (XAxis, YAxis, CartesianGrid, Tooltip, Legend, ResponsiveContainer, BarChart, Bar, ScatterChart, Scatter form chart) <br>
imports will help in rendering and defining the graph<br>
added a heading as bar graph and scartter graph<br>
make changes in css to make the text center with blue color and underline it <br>
use another array to sort the data in ascending order of color intnsity<br>
using responsivecontainer make the graph page responsive on other devices<br>
set height width and margin of the graph for better viewing expreience<br>
set the cartisian grid<br>
set X and y axis<br>
take the data from given dataset<br>
use the different chart function to get and show the value of graph <br>

 ## running the project 
 to run this project just type **_yarn start_** in the terminal of the project after opening it<br>
 this will automatically open a web page with react logo and run the app<br>
 we can also use localhost:30000 to open it in desired browser, to run it locally.

 ## future work
 the data can be further sorted in differnt order for different use<br>
 the data can also be used to make a single graph which can show different features of different alcohol<br>
 it can be made more interective for general purpose use<br>
